## Network Alarm Respons (NAR)
### Conceptual Smoke Alarm for Your Network

This project aims to develop a device powered by a small **LOCAL** AI/LLM model that monitors network traffic in real-time and provides actionable insights to improve your home network security.

### Design Philosophy
The design follows these principles:
1. **Real-time Analysis**: Process network data in real-time using lightweight models
2. **Minimal Hardware Requirements**: Runs on SBC with NPU for efficient processing
3. **User-friendly Output**: Provides clear explanations and remediation steps

### Current Status
The project is currently in concept phase. The roadmap includes:
1. **Dual Operation Mode**:
   - Standalone operation (beside router)
   - Integrated operation (running alongside OpenWRT)

### Technical Requirements
- **Hardware**:
  - SBC with NPU (e.g., Raspberry Pi with AI accelerator)
  - Low power consumption
  - Sufficient RAM (2-4GB)
- **Software**:
  - Lightweight LLM model
  - Real-time packet capture
  - Network traffic analysis algorithms

### Next Steps
1. **Model Selection**: Evaluate and select appropriate models for network analysis
2. **Hardware Testing**: Assess performance on various SBC platforms
3. **Integration**: Develop mechanisms to integrate with existing home automation systems

### Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy**: Focus on network behavior rather than individual packets
- **Resource Consumption**: Designed to run on low-power hardware

This concept leverages advances in ML models to make network monitoring accessible to the average home user without requiring extensive technical knowledge or hardware upgrades.

## AI Foundation

The core AI component will utilize the **White Rabbit NEO** language model, which is specifically designed for network analysis tasks. This model requires minimal training data and can be fine-tuned with custom datasets specific to your network environment.

## Graphical User Interface

For visualization and monitoring, Grafana will be integrated into the system. Grafana provides:
- Real-time network traffic visualization
- Historical data analysis
- Customizable dashboards

## Simplified Security Onion Integration

The project will simplify the integration of Security Onion features, which typically require significant expertise to configure and maintain. Key features will include:
- Vulnerability assessment
- Traffic flow visualization
- Protocol analysis

## Implementation Plan

1. **Model Training**:
   - Train the White Rabbit NEO model on network traffic data collected from real home networks
   - Focus on common vulnerabilities and attack patterns

2. **Hardware Selection**:
   - Select SBCs with sufficient NPU and RAM (Raspberry Pi 4 with AI accelerator)
   - Evaluate power consumption and heat generation

3. **Integration Development**:
   - Develop APIs for Grafana integration
   - Create custom visualization plugins

## Expected Outcomes

- **Early Detection**: Identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited
- **Intuitive Dashboard**: Visualize network health without requiring technical expertise
- **Automated Remediation**: Suggest actions to remediate detected issues

## Ethical Integration

- **Privacy Preservation**: Focus on network behavior rather than packet inspection
- **Resource Efficiency**: Designed to operate on low-power hardware

This project will make advanced network monitoring accessible to all home network users, providing peace of mind and actionable insights without requiring extensive technical knowledge.
