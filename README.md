## Protect Your Home Network from Cyber Threats with a Simple, Open-Source Solution

Imagine having a personal bodyguard for your home network, always on the lookout for potential threats and vulnerabilities. That's what Network Alarm Response (NAR) aims to be - a simple, open-source, and user-friendly solution to safeguard your home network from cyber threats.

## The Problem
As more devices connect to your home network, the risk of cyber attacks increases. But network security can be overwhelming, especially for those without technical expertise. That's why we need a solution that's easy to use, doesn't require a degree in computer science, and is affordable. 🤔
## Enter NAR
NAR is designed to be a simple, open-source, and user-friendly solution to safeguard your home network from cyber threats. With NAR, you'll get:
* Early Threat Detection: Identify potential threats before they become incidents. 🔍
* Automated Protection: Continuous scanning for vulnerabilities without interruption. 🔄
* Peace of Mind: Focus on what matters, knowing your network is secure. 😌
### How it Works
NAR uses a lightweight AI model to monitor network packets in real-time, detecting:
* Data exfiltration attempts 🚫
* Known attack vectors 🚪
* Unusual protocol behavior 📊
NAR leverages the power of Zeek (formerly known as Bro), a renowned network analysis framework, to provide a deep understanding of your network traffic. With Zeek, NAR can:
* Capture and analyze network packets 📈
* Identify potential threats and anomalies 🔍
* Provide detailed insights into network behavior 📊
* 
### Join the Journey

We're just getting started, and we need your help! As an open-source project, NAR is designed to be community-driven. Here's what we're working on:

1. **Model Selection**: Evaluating and selecting the best models for network analysis.
2. **Hardware Testing**: Assessing performance on various SBC platforms.
3. **Integration**: Developing mechanisms to integrate with existing home network systems.

### But Here's the Catch...

We've just received a mysterious network traffic capture that suggests a new, highly sophisticated threat is lurking in the wild. Our AI model has detected some unusual patterns, but we need your expertise to analyze and mitigate this threat.

**Can you help us crack the code?**

Join our community, contribute to the development, and together, let's make NAR the ultimate home network guardian.

### Get Involved

* **Fork the repository**: Share your ideas and contribute to the codebase.
* **Join the discussion**: Share your thoughts and expertise on our community forum.
* **Star the project**: Show your support and help us spread the word.

Let's work together to make NAR a reality and keep our home networks safe from cyber threats.

### Roadmap

* **Q1**: Model selection and hardware testing
* **Q2**: Integration development and alpha release
* **Q3**: Beta release and community testing
* **Q4**: Final release and maintenance

### Technical Requirements

* **Hardware**: SBC with NPU (e.g., Raspberry Pi with AI accelerator), low power consumption, and sufficient RAM (2-4GB).
* **Software**: Lightweight LLM model (e.g., llama.cpp), real-time packet capture tools (e.g., Suricata, Snort, Zeek), and network traffic analysis algorithms (e.g., ZMap, Ettercap).

### Contribute

Contributions are what make open-source projects great. We're excited to see what you'll bring to the table. Whether you're a developer, a security expert, or just someone who cares about home network security, we welcome your contributions.
