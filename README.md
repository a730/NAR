# NAR
## Network Alarm Respons (NAR)
### Smoke Alarm for Your Network
This project aims to develop a device powered by a small LOCAL AI/LLM model that monitors network traffic in real-time and provides actionable insights to improve your home network security.

#### Why You Need This in Your Home
Just as smoke alarms protect your home from fire, NAR protects your network from cyber threats. 
Here's why you should have this in your home:
- Prevent Data Theft: Many attacks occur silently without obvious signs. NAR detects these attacks before they can exfiltrate your data.
- Automated Protection: Unlike manual monitoring, NAR continuously scans for vulnerabilities without interruption.
- Peace of Mind: By identifying attacks early, you can focus on other tasks knowing your network is secure.
- Resource Efficiency: Unlike cloud-based solutions, NAR runs locally using minimal resources, eliminating bandwidth usage and data leakage concerns.
 
#### Real-time Analysis
NAR continuously monitors network packets using lightweight models trained to detect:
- Data exfiltration
- Known attack vectors
- Unusual protocol behavior
- Ethical Data Handling
- Data Localization: All processing occurs locally on your network
- Transparency: Clear visualization of what data is being analyzed

### Design Philosophy
The design follows these principles:
1. **Real-time Analysis**: Process network data in real-time using lightweight models
2. **Minimal Hardware Requirements**: Runs on SBC with NPU for efficient processing
3. **User-friendly Output**: Provides clear explanations and remediation steps

### Current Status
The project is currently in concept phase. The roadmap includes:
1. **Dual Operation Mode**:
   - Standalone operation (beside router)
   - Integrated operation (running alongside OpenWRT)

### Technical Requirements
- **Hardware**:
  - SBC with NPU (e.g., Raspberry Pi with AI accelerator)
  - Low power consumption
  - Sufficient RAM (2-4GB)
- **Software**:
  - Lightweight LLM model: *llama.cpp*
  - Real-time packet capture: *suricatta/Snort/zeek,Wireshark & Tshark,Elasticsearch & Kibana*
  - Network traffic analysis algorithms: *zmap,ettercap,dsniff,ntopng,NetworkMiner,NetFlow/IPFIX Tools*
  - Other: *MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)*
### Next Steps
1. **Model Selection**: Evaluate and select appropriate models for network analysis
2. **Hardware Testing**: Assess performance on various SBC platforms
3. **Integration**: Develop mechanisms to integrate with existing home network systems

### Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy**: Focus on network behavior rather than individual packets
- **Resource Consumption**: Designed to run on low-power hardware 24/7

This concept leverages advances in ML models to make network monitoring accessible to the average home user without requiring extensive technical knowledge or hardware upgrades.

## AI Foundation

The core AI component will utilize the **White Rabbit NEO** language model, which is specifically designed for network analysis tasks. This model requires minimal training data and can be fine-tuned with custom datasets specific to your network environment.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Model Training**:
   - Train the White Rabbit NEO model on network traffic data collected from real home networks
   - Focus on common vulnerabilities and attack patterns

2. **Hardware Selection**:
   - Select SBCs with sufficient NPU and RAM (Raspberry Pi 4 with AI accelerator)
   - Evaluate power consumption and heat generation

3. **Integration Development**:
   - Develop APIs for Grafana integration
   - Create custom visualization plugins

## Expected Outcomes

- **Early Detection**: Identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited
- **Intuitive Dashboard**: Visualize network health without requiring technical expertise
- **Automated Remediation**: Suggest actions to remediate detected issues

## Ethical Integration

- **Privacy Preservation**: Focus on network behavior rather than packet inspection
- **Resource Efficiency**: Designed to operate on low-power hardware

This project will make advanced network monitoring accessible to all home network users, providing peace of mind and actionable insights without requiring extensive technical knowledge.
