# NAR Zero-Day & Zero-Trust Defense System

This project is an AI-Driven Zero-Day Exploit Detection and Defense System designed to provide robust protection against zero-day vulnerabilities. By leveraging advanced AI models, real-time monitoring, and automated response mechanisms, this system aims to detect and neutralize threats before they can exploit unknown vulnerabilities in your infrastructure.

Imagine having a personal bodyguard for your home network, always on the lookout for potential threats and vulnerabilities. That's what Network Alarm Response (NAR) aims to be - a simple, open-source, and user-friendly solution to safeguard your home network from cyber threats.
As more devices connect to your home network, the risk of cyber attacks increases. But network security can be overwhelming, especially for those without technical expertise. That's why we need a solution that's easy to use, doesn't require a degree in computer science, and is affordable. 

Zero-day vulnerabilities are called “zero-day” for a reason — there’s zero time to react. The only way forward is to predict, detect, and respond in real time.

## Why Traditional Security Fails
*Here’s the uncomfortable truth:*
- *Most conventional security models are reactive.*
- *Static scanners rely on known patterns.*
- *Signature-based detection can’t predict novel exploits.*
- *Human-led audits are time-consuming and incomplete.*
- *Zero-days exist in the blind spots of traditional defenses.*


## Features

- **Early Threat Detection**: Identify potential threats before they become incidents. 🔍
- **Automated Protection**: Continuous scanning for vulnerabilities without interruption. 🔄
- **Peace of Mind**: Focus on what matters, knowing your network is secure. 😌
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes machine learning models to detect previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-time.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors network traffic and system behavior to identify potential threats.
- **Automated Response**: Implements defense mechanisms to neutralize threats as they are detected.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyzes system and user behavior to identify anomalies that indicate zero-day exploits.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integrates with global threat intelligence feeds to stay ahead of emerging threats.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on detected vulnerabilities and actions taken to mitigate them.

## How it Works

### NAR uses a lightweight AI model to monitor network packets in real-time, detecting:

- Data exfiltration attempts 🚫
- Known attack vectors 🚪
- Unusual protocol behavior 📊
  
### NAR leverages the power of Zeek (formerly known as Bro), a renowned network analysis framework, to provide a deep understanding of your network traffic. With Zeek, NAR can:

- Capture and analyze network packets 📈
- Identify potential threats and anomalies 🔍
- Provide detailed insights into network behavior 📊

# Project Objective
Build an AI-driven zero-day exploit detection and response platform with a web dashboard, scalable backend, and complete documentation—organized so any team member can pick up tasks and contribute.
#### Research & Planning
- Survey existing zero-day detection techniques and define success metrics
- Select ML algorithms, threat-intelligence feeds, and data sources
- Gather and preprocess datasets
- Draft project scope, timeline, and resource assignments
#### System Design
- Architect end-to-end data flow: capture → processing → storage → response
- Specify major components: AI models, detection engine, monitoring agents, response module
- Design KuzuDB schema and SvelteKit front-end wireframes
#### AI Model Development
- Feature engineering and dataset preparation
- Train supervised models on known exploits and anomaly detectors for new threats
- Validate with cross-validation; tune for precision, recall, F1
#### Core Backend & API
- Implement real-time traffic/system monitoring agents
- Integrate AI models into a detection service
- Build automated response workflows (alerts, quarantine, etc.)
- Expose REST/GraphQL endpoints for dashboard and third-party integrations
- Secure, scale, and optimize the KuzuDB instance
#### Front-End Dashboard
- Develop an interactive SvelteKit UI for live alerts, threat history, and system health
- Create configuration panels for thresholds, rules, and response policies
- Design data visualizations (charts, timelines, tables)
- Write integrated API docs and code snippets for external use
#### Testing & Integration
- Unit-test each module; perform end-to-end integration tests
- Run performance benchmarks under simulated high-load conditions
- Conduct security assessments (penetration tests, code reviews)
#### Deployment & Scaling
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated build, test, and deploy
- Deploy on cloud or on-prem; configure autoscaling and load balancing
- Implement redundancy, backups, and disaster-recovery strategies
- Monitor live performance and adjust infrastructure as needed
#### Documentation & Onboarding
- Maintain up-to-date architecture diagrams, setup guides, and ops runbooks
- Publish user manuals for dashboard operations and API usage
- Create training materials (slides, video walkthroughs, sample projects)
#### Ongoing Maintenance & Improvement
- Continuously monitor system health, security, and model drift
- Schedule regular model retraining and software updates
- Collect user feedback and track feature requests
- Iterate on detection accuracy, UI/UX, and performance

### Documentation Updates
- Regular updates to documentation as new features are developed or existing features are enhanced.
- Ensure all changes are logged in the project’s change log.
