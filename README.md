# NAR Zero-Day & Zero-Trust Defense System

This project is an AI-Driven Zero-Day Exploit Detection and Defense System designed to provide robust protection against zero-day vulnerabilities. By leveraging advanced AI models, real-time monitoring, and automated response mechanisms, this system aims to detect and neutralize threats before they can exploit unknown vulnerabilities in your infrastructure.

Imagine having a personal bodyguard for your home network, always on the lookout for potential threats and vulnerabilities. That's what Network Alarm Response (NAR) aims to be - a simple, open-source, and user-friendly solution to safeguard your home network from cyber threats.
As more devices connect to your home network, the risk of cyber attacks increases. But network security can be overwhelming, especially for those without technical expertise. That's why we need a solution that's easy to use, doesn't require a degree in computer science, and is affordable. 

Zero-day vulnerabilities are called ‚Äúzero-day‚Äù for a reason ‚Äî there‚Äôs zero time to react. The only way forward is to predict, detect, and respond in real time.

## Why Traditional Security Fails
*Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth:*
- *Most conventional security models are reactive.*
- *Static scanners rely on known patterns.*
- *Signature-based detection can‚Äôt predict novel exploits.*
- *Human-led audits are time-consuming and incomplete.*
- *Zero-days exist in the blind spots of traditional defenses.*


## Features

- **Early Threat Detection**: Identify potential threats before they become incidents. üîç
- **Automated Protection**: Continuous scanning for vulnerabilities without interruption. üîÑ
- **Peace of Mind**: Focus on what matters, knowing your network is secure. üòå
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes machine learning models to detect previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-time.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors network traffic and system behavior to identify potential threats.
- **Automated Response**: Implements defense mechanisms to neutralize threats as they are detected.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyzes system and user behavior to identify anomalies that indicate zero-day exploits.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integrates with global threat intelligence feeds to stay ahead of emerging threats.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on detected vulnerabilities and actions taken to mitigate them.

## How it Works

### NAR uses a lightweight AI model to monitor network packets in real-time, detecting:

- Data exfiltration attempts üö´
- Known attack vectors üö™
- Unusual protocol behavior üìä
  
### NAR leverages the power of Zeek (formerly known as Bro), a renowned network analysis framework, to provide a deep understanding of your network traffic. With Zeek, NAR can:

- Capture and analyze network packets üìà
- Identify potential threats and anomalies üîç
- Provide detailed insights into network behavior üìä

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-ZeroDay-Detection.git
   cd AI-ZeroDay-Detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment-specific configurations, such as database credentials and API keys.

4. **Initialize the database**:
   Set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the system**:
   Start the application with:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
